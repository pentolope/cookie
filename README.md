------------------------------------

This is a custom CPU for an FPGA. It is still in the process of being made.

I have not figured out a licence yet, but don't use this and claim it as your own.
For now, I am not providing instructions on how things work.
Several of the scripts I use will not work on other computers (typically due to usage of absolute file paths).
